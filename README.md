MachineLearning + Genetic Nets was a project to help me
understand how ML libraries worked. It is a simple implementation of genetic
algorithims and basic neural nets.

It could be useful for understanding ML, but is definitely
not code anyone should use in their projects.

For more useful ML projects, see my more recent repos.
